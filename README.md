# A basic example to highlight some thoughts on HTML/CSS/JS development and consistency

This is an example project using require.js, backbone.js, underscore.js, jQuery and a couple of require.js plugins.

There are README's scattered throughout the directories explaining functionality or standards in their respective areas.

Note: At this time, the Maven build still isn't functional, run this example by accessing src/main/www/index-dev.html,
as it uses require.js directly to load dependencies.  Maven support coming soon.

If you find an issue, have a comment or a better approach, the issues tab is where it's at.
